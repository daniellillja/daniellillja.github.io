Hello everyone, and thanks for reading my blog.

I intend for this site to be a collection of posts focusing on my job (commercial web development) as well as other interests of mine. I want to document some basic tutorials on the topics I am learning as well as the insights I get on the job over time. I hope you enjoy.
